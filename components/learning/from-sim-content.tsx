          The psychological shift from simulator to live trading can be challenging. Here's how to make the transition
          smoothly and successfully.

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Start Small</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Begin with the minimum account size and smallest position sizes. Don't try to make back losses or hit profit
          targets quickly. Focus on executing your strategy properly with real money.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Expect Emotional Challenges</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Real money creates real emotions. Fear, greed, excitement, and disappointment will be stronger than in demo.
          Acknowledge these feelings but don't let them control your decisions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Keep Trading the Same Way</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Don't change your strategy when you go live. Trade exactly as you did in demo - same risk per trade, same
          entry/exit rules, same position sizes relative to account size.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Review and Adjust</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          After your first month of live trading, review your journal. Are you following your plan? How do your results
          compare to demo? Make adjustments based on data, not emotions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Scale Up Gradually</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Once you're consistently profitable with small sizes, gradually increase your position size. Never jump to
          large positions - scale up slowly as your confidence and account grow.
