          If you are too busy to follow the news and monitor the charts all day, it is possible to participate in Binary
          Options trading in an easier and less time-consuming way. Social Trading allows you to connect with
          experienced traders, see their performance statistics (including gain percentages), discuss their trading
          ideas, learn from their mistakes and copy their successful strategies.

        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Discover traders you want to follow and add to your watch list. View their past performance stats, read status
          updates on their strategies, see their live positions, analyze results and communicate with them. You can
          literally tap into the wisdom of the crowd.

        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          If you are satisfied with the results and trading style, you can copy their trades with one click of a button.
          The best part is that all trades will be made proportionally to your account size - if the PRO trader deposits
          10% of his account into the position (which might be $10,000), then a position will also be opened with 10% of
          YOUR account (which might be just $100), thus significantly lowering the exposure to risk.

          Now you can sit back and watch how experienced traders do the work for you. Your task is to carefully analyze
          their results and learn as much as possible from their trades. The ultimate goal of social trading is to build
          a portfolio of the best traders.

            <p className="text-purple-400 font-semibold mb-2">1. Be Careful With Figures That Look Too Positive</p>
            <p className="text-white/80">
              A positive profit margin does not always point to lasting success, so it is important to investigate how
              well the trader managed over a longer time frame. Test first with a virtual trading account.
            </p>
          </div>

            <p className="text-purple-400 font-semibold mb-2">2. Allocate A Maximum of 20% Per Trade</p>
            <p className="text-white/80">
              It's wise not to put all of your money in one trade. Diversify risk by only trading 5-20% of your total
              deposit.

            <p className="text-purple-400 font-semibold mb-2">3. Talk With A Pro</p>
            <p className="text-white/80">
              Try to start a conversation with an experienced trader, either online or in person. Ask what amount they
              recommend for you to copy their trades, what stop loss they recommend, and any other questions.

            <p className="text-white/80">
              If you want your investments to be safe, it is recommended to copy traders with at least 1 year of
              experience.
            </p>

            <p className="text-purple-400 font-semibold mb-2">5. Check The Results Frequently</p>
            <p className="text-white/80">
              Sometimes traders lose control by opening too many positions at once. Regularly follow all portfolios to
              be sure that your traders cut losses short and let profits run. Also remember to set up Copy-Stop-Loss
              orders.

          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            The proportion between transferred funds to the particular trader and the initial capital of the trader is
            $5:$1,000 or 1:200.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-2">
            If the trader invests $200 or 20% in a transaction, then $5 will be invested from your account by copying
            his behavior, which is 20% of your $25.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-300 leading-relaxed">
            Naturally, if the trader you copy earns, you also earn a profit. Therefore, if the trader earns $20 when
            investing $200 (which is 10%), then you earn $0.50 when investing $5.
