        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Making the transition from demo trading to live trading is a significant step. Before you risk real money,
          ensure you've met these essential criteria.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Consistent Profitability in Demo</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You should achieve consistent profits over at least 3 months of demo trading. One lucky week isn't enough -
          you need to prove your strategy works across different market conditions.

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Solid Risk Management</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You must consistently follow risk management rules: never risk more than 1-2% per trade, use stop losses on
          every trade, and maintain a positive risk-reward ratio. No exceptions.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Trading Plan and Journal</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Have a written trading plan that covers your strategy, risk management, and trading schedule. Keep a detailed
          trading journal tracking every trade, your reasoning, and outcomes.

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Emotional Control</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Can you handle losses without revenge trading? Do you stick to your plan even when emotions run high?
          Emotional discipline is crucial when real money is on the line.

      <section>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Financial Readiness</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Only trade with money you can afford to lose. Pay off high-interest debt first, have an emergency fund, and
          never use money needed for bills or essential expenses.
