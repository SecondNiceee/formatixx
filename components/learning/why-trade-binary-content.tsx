          <li>The stock market declines</li>
          <li>The real estate transactions freeze</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          If your predictions are correct, then Binary Options can remain profitable even in the worst of times because
          currencies are always traded in pairs. When the value of one currency declines, the value of the other one
          rises.

          Pretty awesome, huh? You can earn, regardless of whether the market is trending up or down, but if your
          prediction is wrong, you can lose as much.

          smartphone and an Internet connection. Many successful Binary Options traders use advanced trading apps on

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Start With $250</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Unlike any other financial market, Binary Options have low entry costs due to the large number of market
          participants. Also, the increasing competition among brokers lowers their commissions and consequently
          transaction costs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Currently, Binary Options are the most cost-effective market for retail investors. In Binary Options, you can
          start trading with $100-$2000. As you start to get a stronger grasp of binary options trading and risk
          management, invest more. Remember that losses are a part of the game even for experienced traders, but the
          more you learn, the less likely you will make rookie mistakes.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Easy Rules</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          In 2023 there are more than 45,000 publicly traded companies worldwide and although there are many currencies
          in the binary options market, traders work mainly with just 8. In addition, the value of currencies is
          affected by significantly fewer factors than the value of stocks. As a result, it's relatively easier for you
          to follow and predict changes in Binary Options market.

        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          With a daily turnover of more than $6.6 trillion, binary Options are the most liquid financial market. There
          is always a buyer when you want to sell, and there is always a seller when you want to buy. This is highly
          reassuring! But it can get better, if you build more money to earn more money, which you can withdraw whenever
          you want!
