        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Market Hours</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Stock markets operate during business hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST for US markets). Forex markets run 24/5,
          giving you flexibility to trade whenever you want.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Market Size and Liquidity</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Forex is the largest financial market with $7+ trillion daily volume. Stock markets are smaller but still
          highly liquid. Higher Forex liquidity means tighter spreads and easier execution.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Number of Options</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Stock markets have thousands of companies to choose from. Forex focuses on major currency pairs - typically
          7-8 pairs account for most trading. Fewer choices can mean easier decision-making.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Leverage and Capital Requirements</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Forex typically offers higher leverage (50:1, 100:1, or more) compared to stocks (2:1 for day trading). This
          means you can start Forex trading with less capital, though higher leverage also means higher risk.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Which is Right for You?</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Choose stocks if you prefer owning company shares, researching businesses, and trading during set hours.
          Choose Forex if you want 24/5 access, lower capital requirements, and focus on macroeconomic trends.
