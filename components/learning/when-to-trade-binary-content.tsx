        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          There is a specific period widely regarded as the prime time for trading all assets. In short, that is when
          there is the most activity in the markets, with traders from around the world participating in the buzz.

            The overlap between the London and New York sessions, which occurs from{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">8 am to 12 pm ET</span>, is the most active and liquid time of the day for
            trading currencies, stocks, and other assets.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          This period is characterised by high volumes and significant volatility, which means there are more
          opportunities for you to enter and exit trades.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Binary Options</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The flexibility of binary options trading hours is a significant advantage, allowing you to access the market
          from anywhere in the world on weekdays.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          For those unable to trade during the London-New York overlap, off-peak hours can still offer some advantages.
          Trading during the Asian session can be beneficial if you trade the yen or other Asian currencies, and major
          news releases outside of peak trading hours can create big moves despite lower market activity.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Stocks/Indices</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The first hour after the stock market opens is widely considered the most profitable time for stock trading.
          During this time, there is increased volatility and volume as traders react to news and events that occurred
          overnight or before the market opened.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Similarly, the last hour before the market closes is also a time when traders position themselves for the next
          trading day. Indices, such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, are also traded during stock market hours.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Cryptos</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          One of the major attractions of crypto trading is its round-the-clock availability. However, it's worth noting
          that the volume and volatility of the crypto markets can vary depending on the time of day, day of the week,
          and news releases that impact the industry.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Typically, the highest volume and volatility in the crypto market can be observed on weekends when traditional
          markets are closed. Additionally, some crypto exchanges experience higher trading volumes during specific
          hours, such as early mornings or late evenings.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Commodities</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Commodities such as gold, oil, and agricultural products have different peak trading hours. For instance, gold
          tends to be more volatile during the overlap of the European and US sessions (8 am to 2 pm ET), while oil
          prices typically fluctuate the most during US market hours when major reports are released.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">When NOT to Trade</h3>
        <p className="text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As a beginner, it is advisable to avoid periods of low liquidity, such as Friday afternoons and holidays, and
          major events like Christmas or Prime-time TV events. It is also important to remember that major economic
          reports and news releases can cause significant volatility and unpredictability in the markets.

          <p className="text-red-300 leading-relaxed">
            <span className="font-semibold">Important:</span> It is crucial to be mindful of your emotional and mental
            state when trading. Emotions such as anger, frustration, or exhaustion can negatively impact your
            decision-making and lead to poor results. Avoid trading when you are feeling emotional.
